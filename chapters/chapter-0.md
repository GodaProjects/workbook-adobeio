### Set up I/O Runtime namespace

Please make sure you've installed the OpenWhisk CLI at this step. Go to [Runtime namespaces](../namespaces.md) file to find your assigned namespace based on your assign number (e.g. `user01`), create a `.wskprops` file containing your authorization key, your namespace, and the path to the Runtime API host. Here's an example:
```
AUTH=<Your auth>
APIHOST=runtime.adobe.io
NAMESPACE=<Your namespace>
```
Once your `.wskprops` is ready and set up with your authorization and namesapce, place it in your home directory, where the CLI can access it to set those properties when it starts.

An alternative method to configure your instance of the CLI is to do it through a CLI command. Open a command-line window and type the following command:

```
wsk property set --apihost runtime.adobe.io --auth <Your auth> --namespace <Your namespace>
```
